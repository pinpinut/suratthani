				<h3>Surat Thani</h3>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of Surat Thani was already
					inhabited in prehistoric times by Semang and Malayan tribes.
					Founded in the 3rd century, until the 13th century the Srivijaya
					kingdom dominated the Malay Peninsula. The city Chaiya contains
					several ruins from Srivijaya times, and was probably a regional
					capital of the kingdom. Some Thai historians even claim that it was
					the capital of the kingdom itself for some time, but this is
					generally disputed. Wiang Sa was another main settlement of that
					time. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fall of the
					Srivijaya, it was divided into the cities (mueang) Chaiya, Thatong
					(now Kanchanadit), and Khirirat Nikhom. While Chaiya was
					administered directly from the capital, Thatong and Khirirat were
					controlled by the Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom. In 1899 they were
					merged into one province named Chaiya. In 1915, the court of the
					Monthon Chumphon was moved to Bandon, which received its new name
					Surat Thani on 29 July 1915 during a visit of King Vajiravudh (Rama
					VI). The monthon was renamed Surat accordingly. In 1926 it was
					abolished and incorporated into monthon Nakhon Si Thammarat. In
					1933 the monthon was dissolved, so the province became the first
					level administrative subdivision.

		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous islands along the coast makes Surat Thani (often known as Surat in short) a perfect hideaway for vacationers from around the world. The ideal destination for many is the Penang-sized Ko Samui, Thailandâ€™s third largest island, and its neighbour Ko Pha-ngan a celebrated island that hosts the biggest beach full moon party. North of Ko Pha-ngan is Ko Tao, renowned for its excellent coral reefs. To top it all is the dazzling 250-sq km Ang Thong Marine National Park, where a stunning archipelago awaits to greet visitors with their charming palm-fringed beaches, crystal clear water and colorful coral reefs. The best time to enjoy one of these islands to the fullest is from April to November.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Surat Thani is an important commercial and shipping hub for rubber and coconut trading.</p>

			 <p><h3>Chak Phra Festival</h3>When: October <br>Where: District Office of Surat Thani<br> This festival is held in October every year. Surat Thani celebrates the official end of the annual 3-month Buddhist Rains retreat (Phansa) with the Chak Phra Festival (literally the procession of hauling the Buddha image). The tradition stems from the belief that the Buddha ascended to Heaven during Phansa to preach to his mother. The festival marks the Buddha's return to Earth, and is an occasion for religious merit-making and general celebrations. Local people organize dazzling land and waterborne processions of revered Buddha images (to symbolize the Buddha's return to Earth) and boat races on the Tapi River where long boats, each manned by up to 50 oarsmen, are ebulliently raced. Religious devotion, spectacle and merriment combine to make Surat Thani's Chak Phra Festival a memorable annual event.
